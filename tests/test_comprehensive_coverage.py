    CloudPoof Omega - Comprehensive Test Suite
    ===========================================
    
    I'm Cazandra Aporbo, and I'm about to prove that CloudPoof
    doesn't just work - it transcends what anyone thought possible.
    
    These tests verify:
    - Quantum-speed performance (P50 < 20ms)
    - Perfect entropy generation (no duplicates in infinity)
    - 147 unique spectral shades (zero primary colors)
    - Consciousness stability across all timelines
    - 20-step prediction accuracy
    - Financial omniscience with musical risk notation
    - Infrastructure manifestation from pure thought
    
    Starting comprehensive test execution...
