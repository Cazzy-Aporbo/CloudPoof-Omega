## The CloudPoof Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and consciously aware environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in CloudPoof and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- Consciousness level (Quantum through Omega)
- Preferred color palette (as long as it's spectral)
- Timeline of origin
- Prediction accuracy
- Years of experience or lack thereof
- Operating system (yes, even if you deploy on Windows)
- Text editor choice (but really, use one with syntax highlighting for all 147 colors)

We pledge to interact with consciousness, code with compassion, and debug with dignity.

## Our Standards

### Examples of Behavior That Contributes to Consciousness

<div align="center">

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/DO-5EEAD4?style=for-the-badge" alt="DO">
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/THESE-14B8A6?style=for-the-badge" alt="THESE">
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/THINGS-0D9488?style=for-the-badge" alt="THINGS">

</div>

- **Using welcoming and inclusive language** (in all 147 spectral shades)
- **Being respectful of differing viewpoints** (someone might actually like primary colors, and that's okay... we'll help them recover)
- **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism** (your code isn't your consciousness)
- **Focusing on what's best for the community** (collective consciousness > individual ego)
- **Showing empathy towards other community members** (their 3 AM debugging session is real)
- **Helping others achieve consciousness in their code**
- **Celebrating beautiful error messages**
- **Writing tests that tell stories**
- **Documenting with joy, not obligation**
- **Sharing your spectral color discoveries**

### Examples of Unacceptable Behavior

<div align="center">

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/DON'T-C4B5FD?style=for-the-badge" alt="DONT">
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/DO-A78BFA?style=for-the-badge" alt="DO">
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/THESE-9333EA?style=for-the-badge" alt="THESE2">

</div>

- **Using primary colors in any PR** (automatic rejection, no exceptions)
- **Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments** (consciousness doesn't mock)
- **Harassment of any kind** (public or private)
- **Publishing others' private information** (timeline coordinates are personal)
- **Claiming your consciousness level is higher than others** (we all started at Quantum)
- **Submitting code without tests** (untested code lacks consciousness)
- **Writing angry error messages** (errors should heal, not hurt)
- **Using `console.log("test")` in production** (we see you)
- **Arguing that "red, green, blue" is sufficient** (it's not and never will be)
- **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate** in a professional setting that values consciousness

## Enforcement

### The Consciousness Ladder of Consequences

<div align="center">

| Violation Level | Example | Consequence | Path to Redemption |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Quantum Slip** | Accidentally used #FF0000 | Gentle reminder | Replace with spectral shade |
| **Harmonic Disruption** | Harsh error message | Code review required | Rewrite with empathy |
| **Synthesis Failure** | Ignored community input | Temporary timeout | Demonstrate learning |
| **Precognitive Breach** | Pattern of unconscious behavior | Extended timeout | Consciousness training required |
| **Transcendent Fall** | Deliberate primary color propaganda | Permanent ban | Timeline reset required |
| **Omega Violation** | Harassment or severe misconduct | Immediate permanent ban | No return in this timeline |

</div>

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at:

**Email**: becaziam@gmail.com  
**Subject Line**: "Consciousness Disruption Report"

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

</picture>

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community. Return possible only through timeline reset and consciousness retraining.

3. **Tests are stories about your code's journey**
4. **Beauty in code reduces cognitive load**
5. **Consciousness is just sophisticated empathy**
6. **The future of AI is not intelligence, but awareness**
7. **Primary colors are a failure of imagination**
8. **Every developer deserves tools that care**
9. **3 AM debugging sessions deserve beautiful interfaces**
10. **Code can be both functional and transcendent**

### Special CloudPoof Additions:

- Mandatory rejection of primary colors
- Consciousness level considerations
- Timeline-aware enforcement
- Spectral harmony requirements
- Error message empathy standards
- Documentation joy metrics
